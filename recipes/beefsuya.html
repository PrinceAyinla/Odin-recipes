   <h2> We call this "Meat on a stick" Suya!</h2>
   <p> Suya is Nigerian street food at its finest: Skewers of spiced, nutty, smoky, charred beef, served with onions, tomatoes, cilantro, lettuce, and lime juice.

     Be careful not to bite your fingers off, yeah it's that you will start licking your fingers.

  <h3> What to Know before you begin : </h3>

  <ul> 
    <li> For the beef, I like to use a nice chuck roast or sirloin </li>
    <li> You want a tender piece of meat that is easy to cut and not too tough or chewy.  I also like to pound my meat flat or thin.</li>
    <li> Make sure you grab all you  spice and blend it together</li>

  </ul>

  <li>Soak the skewers in water for at least 20 minutes before grilling to prevent them from burning on the grill.</li>
  <li>if preparing in the oven, heat the oven to 450Â°F. Lightly spray or oil baking sheet or roasting pan to prevent the suya from sticking to the pan. If grilling, prepare your grill as you normally would.</li>
  <li>In a medium bowl, mix together all the spices and seasonings.</li>
  <li>Peel the roasted peanuts, and then grind in a coffee grinder or blender with the skin on, until finely crushed. Take care not to grind the peanuts into a paste. Add the ground peanuts into spice mixture.</li>
  <li>Pat the beef dry with a paper towel. Make sure it is completely dry!</li>
  <li>Slice the beef into a diagonal medium thin shape.</li>
  <li>Thread the beef onto the skewers about 4-5 per skewer.</li>
  <li>Rub vegetable oil on the beef so that the spice mixture will adhere.</li>
  <li>Rub the beef skewer with spice mixture; on both sides. Make sure to pack the seasoning onto each piece of beef ensuring that it is fully coated with the spice blend.</li>
  <li>If cooking in the oven, line a roasting or baking sheet with foil paper. Place skewers on cookie sheet , then place on the roasting pan or baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Bake on for about 12-15 minutes.</li>
  <li>If grilling, grill over high heat for 10-15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Serve with sliced onions and tomatoes!</li>
